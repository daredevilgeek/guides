HTML entities are used to replace reserved characters. If you use the less than (<) or more than (>) character in your text, your browser might confuse the character for part of an HTML tag.

Common HTML character entities include:

    space             &nbsp;      &#160;
<   less than         &lt;        &#60;
>   greater than      &gt;        &#62;
